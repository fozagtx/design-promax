# Rare UI

Catalog + installer for [rareui.com](https://www.rareui.com/components). Every component is a
single file added through the shadcn CLI into the project's own `components/ui/` directory -
the user owns the code.

## Requirements

- React + Tailwind CSS project already configured for shadcn (`components.json` present). If
  the project isn't set up, run `npx shadcn@latest init` first.
- Most components depend on `motion` (framer-motion's successor package) - the CLI installs
  declared npm deps automatically.
- All components registry-depend on `utils` (`cn` helper -> `clsx` + `tailwind-merge`), which
  the CLI resolves on its own.

## Install

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add swamimalode07/rare-ui/<component-name>
```

Component files land in `@/components/ui/<component-name>.tsx` (kebab-case). Import as a
default export:

```tsx
import FluidOrb from "@/components/ui/fluid-orb"
```

Docs/usage/props per component: `https://www.rareui.com/components/<slug>` (slugs are the
names below, concatenated - e.g. `fluidorb`, `bounce-sidebar` -> `bouncesidebar`).

## Catalog

## Notes

- Components are recreations of well-known interactions (Apple/iOS, ChatGPT, Family app) -
  free for personal and commercial use; attribution appreciated; don't resell as a kit.
- Source repo: `github.com/swamimalode07/rare-ui`. Registry JSON: `public/r/registry.json` -
  fetch it to check for new components: `https://www.rareui.com/r/registry.json`.
- When a requested interaction isn't covered here, check the `transitions-dev` /
  `transitions-polish` skills for bespoke CSS transitions instead of a full component.

## Using Rare UI inside a HeroUI project

- The shadcn CLI is an installer only. Run `npx shadcn@latest init` to get components.json, then `npx shadcn@latest add swamimalode07/rare-ui/<name>`. Do not add any shadcn/ui components themselves; HeroUI stays the primitive layer.
- After install, open the file in components/ui/ and restyle: `cn` from `@heroui/react`, surfaces `bg-content1`, text `text-default-500 / text-foreground`, borders `border-default-200`, accent `text-primary / bg-primary`. Remove raw Tailwind colors (zinc-*, gray-*, blue-*).
- `motion` (the package) coexists with framer-motion; prefer `motion/react` import if the project already uses `motion`, else keep framer-motion and swap the import.
- One Rare UI component per screen max. It must look native to the theme (Brutalism: rounded-none + border-2; Glass: bg-content1/60 backdrop-blur; Mouve: mauve accent).
- Allowed atoms by surface:

| Surface | Allowed Rare UI atoms |
|---------|----------------------|
| A landing | scroll-progress, gravity-letters (hero only, optional), code-block (dev products) |
| B auth / H vault | otp-input |
| C app | notification-bell, delete-button (danger rows), bounce-sidebar or hook-sidebar (replaces sidebar nav indicator only), task-list |
| D AI chat | fluid-orb or matrix-orb (listening / thinking state), grid-reveal (image generation) |
| D messaging | emoji-reaction |
| E commerce | animated-counter (cart total), family-drawer (mobile cart / filters) |
| F data / workstation | animated-counter (KPI values), github-activity (heatmap pattern) |
| G forms | step-player, duration-picker |

- Never: folder-component or gravity-letters inside app shells; proximity-sidebar on dense surfaces; two orbs on one screen.
