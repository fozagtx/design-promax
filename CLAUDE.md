## About This Repo

Design ProMax - HeroUI Pro **real sources** + **Pro themes** + **route registry** + **style presets**.  
Canonical product quality: **clean_product** / **Vault OTP** case study (GhostKeys-class UI).

## Files agents must find

Relative to skill root (after install, files are **also flattened** to skill root):

| What | Path |
|------|------|
| Entry | `SKILL.md` |
| **Pro themes** | `THEMES.json` + `themes.css` -> Default - Brutalism - Glass - Mouve |
| Styles | `STYLE_PRESETS.json` -> id **`clean_product`** |
| Routes | `ROUTE_REGISTRY.json` |
| Case study | `case-studies/vault-otp.md` |
| Dense case study | `case-studies/workstation-dense.md` |
| Contract template | `templates/DESIGN.md` |
| External refs | `REFERENCES.md` |
| Motion | `motion/` (tokens, 32 transition snippets, POLISH, RARE_UI) |
| Sources | `sources/` or `skill/sources/` |

If any of those are missing, **reinstall** with `./install.sh ~/.claude/skills` - do not invent them.

## How Agents Use This

0. If project has `DESIGN.md`, read it, skip the gate
1. Load `SKILL.md`
2. **THEME GATE** - ask **Default - Brutalism - Glass - Mouve** (unless user already named one). Load `THEMES.json` + copy **`themes.css`** into the project.
3. Load `STYLE_PRESETS.json` + `ROUTE_REGISTRY.json`
4. Match intent -> surface + route (showcase packs: Map navigation, Pro AI chat, Music player, Shopping)
5. Style -> **`clean_product`** by default (or `trust_green` / `chat_soft` / ...)
6. For "like Vault OTP / GhostKeys / those cards": read **`case-studies/vault-otp.md`**
7. Efficient merge: 3 core files (+ 1 shell App max) = **4 reads**
8. Apply **button_matrix** (pill primary / bordered secondary / flat danger) - Brutalism uses sharp corners
9. Wire `data-theme` from `THEMES.json` using skill **`themes.css`**
10. If user has brand colors: keep them unless they asked for full Brutalism / Glass / Mouve look

## Do not

- Pick a Pro theme silently - always ask first  
- Claim themes are missing / need npm login when `THEMES.json` + `themes.css` exist in the skill  
- Claim `clean_product`, `THEMES.json`, or `case-studies/` do not exist without checking both root and `skill/` paths  
- Browse all of `sources/` randomly  
- Put eng jargon in product UI
- Jam landing and desk onto one page
- Duplicate Connect
- Fade the hero with gradient-clipped type
- Put a job subtitle beside the logo
- Ship a fake ACME footer
